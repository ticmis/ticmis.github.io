Using MuMax3 to simulate micromagnetic processes is a powerful approach to support spin-orbit torque (SOT) switching research. MuMax3 allows efficient and accurate modeling of magnetization dynamics in nanoscale ferromagnetic structures, leveraging GPU acceleration for fast simulations.

For SOT studies, MuMax3 can incorporate torque effects from phenomena like the spin Hall effect or Rashba effect. These can be added using built-in torque functions such as the Slonczewski torque term, modified to represent SOT. This helps simulate current-induced magnetization switching, domain wall motion, or skyrmion dynamics under applied spin-orbit torques.

Users can vary material parameters such as saturation magnetization, damping, anisotropy, and spin Hall angle to study how these affect the switching efficiency and critical current densities. The tool also supports visualization and export of time-resolved magnetization states, aiding in physical insight and comparison with experimental results.

Overall, MuMax3 is a versatile and effective platform for modeling and optimizing SOT-driven magnetization switching in spintronic devices.
